This is a short write up explaining what my program does. 
I have written code designing a vending machine that holds six food items. 
These food items are arranged by letter and number coordinates. 
the items are:
	Hesrhay's Bar which is in position a0 and cost $1.00
	Reese's Bar which is in position a1 and cost $1.00
	Heath Bar which is in position a2 and cost $1.50 
	Coca-Cola which is in position b0 and cost $1.50
	Sprite which is in position b1 and cost $2.00
	Dr Pepper which is in position b2 and cost $2.00 
	
The code starts by asking if you are a technician or customer.
You answer this based on what you want to do.
The technician can restock the machine and change the prices of items as needed. 
The customer can buy food items as wanted.
	You start by entering money, then you make your selection, and your item is dispensed.
	Then if you have change it is dispensed and the machine is reset for the next customer.
